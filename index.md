## Exceptions

### PrecisionOverflowException

> Indicates that the number of bits of precision requested by
> a computation on constructive reals required more than 28 bits,
> and was thus in danger of overflowing an int.
> This is likely to be a symptom of a diverging computation,
> *e.g.* division by zero.

### ZeroDivisionException

Division by zero.

### ArithmeticException

Arithmetic Exception.

### NumberFormatException

Invalid radix.

### AssertionError

Assertion Error.

## class CR

### Introduction

> Constructive real numbers, also known as recursive, or computable reals.
> Each recursive real number is represented as an object that provides an
> approximation function for the real number.  
> The approximation function guarantees that the generated approximation
> is accurate to the specified precision.  
> Arithmetic operations on constructive reals produce new such objects;
> they typically do not perform any real computation.  
> In this sense, arithmetic computations are exact: They produce
> a description which describes the exact answer, and can be used to
> later approximate it to arbitrary precision.
>
> When approximations are generated, *e.g.* for output, they are
> accurate to the requested precision; no cumulative rounding errors
> are visible.  
> In order to achieve this precision, the approximation function will often
> need to approximate subexpressions to greater precision than was originally
> demanded.  Thus the approximation of a constructive real number
> generated through a complex sequence of operations may eventually require
> evaluation to very high precision.  This usually makes such computations
> prohibitively expensive for large numerical problems.  
> But it is perfectly appropriate for use in a desk calculator,
> for small numerical problems, for the evaluation of expressions
> computated by a symbolic algebra system, for testing of accuracy claims
> for floating point code on small inputs, or the like.
>
> We expect that the vast majority of uses will ignore the particular
> implementation, and the member functons `approximate`
> and `get_appr`.  Such applications will treat `CR` as
> a conventional numerical type, with an interface modelled on
> `java.math.BigInteger`.  No subclasses of `CR`
> will be explicitly mentioned by such a program.
>
> All standard arithmetic operations, as well as a few algebraic
> and transcendal functions are provided.  Constructive reals are
> immutable; thus all of these operations return a new constructive real.
>
> A few uses will require explicit construction of approximation functions.
> The requires the construction of a subclass of `CR` with
> an overridden `approximate` function.  Note that `approximate`
> should only be defined, but never called.  `get_appr`
> provides the same functionality, but adds the caching necessary to obtain
> reasonable performance.
>
> Any operation may also throw `PrecisionOverflowException`
> If the precision request generated during any subcalculation overflows
> a 28-bit integer.  (This should be extremely unlikely, except as an
> outcome of a division by zero, or other erroneous computation.)

### CR.ZERO
`static ZERO: CR = CR.valueOfN(0n)`

### CR.ONE
`static ONE: CR = CR.valueOfN(1n)`

### CR.PI
`static PI: CR`

The ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter.

### CR.atan_PI
`static atan_PI: CR`

Our old PI implementation. Keep this around for now to allow checking.  
This implementation may also be faster for `BigInteger` implementations
that support only quadratic multiplication, but exhibit high performance
for small computations.  (The standard Android 6 implementation supports
subquadratic multiplication, but has high constant overhead.) Many other
atan-based formulas are possible, but based on superficial
experimentation, this is roughly as good as the more complex formulas.

### CR.valueOfN(n)
`static valueOfN(n: bigint): CR`

The constructive real number corresponding to a `bigint`.

### CR.valueOfS(s, radix?)
`static valueOfS(s: String, radix?: int): CR`

Return the constructive real number corresponding to the given
textual representation and radix.  
**Parameters:**
* `s` - [-] digit\* [. digit\*]
* `radix` - radix

### CR.shift(k, n)
`static shift(k: bigint, n: bigint): bigint`

Multiply `k` by `2**n`.

### CR.scale(k, n)
`static scale(k: bigint, n: bigint): bigint`

Multiply by `2**n`, rounding result.

### CR.zeroes(n)
`static zeroes(n: int): string`

A helper function for `toString`.
Generate a `string` containing `n` zeroes.

### compareToRA(x, r, a)
`compareToRA(x: CR, r: int, a: int): int`

Return `0` if `x = y` to within the indicated tolerance,
`-1` if `x < y`, and `+1` if `x > y`.  If `x` and `y` are indeed
equal, it is guaranteed that `0` will be returned.  If
they differ by less than the tolerance, anything
may happen.  The tolerance allowed is
the maximum of `(abs(this)+abs(x))*(2**r)` and `2**a`.  
**Parameters:**
* `x` - The other constructive real
* `r` - Relative tolerance in bits
* `a` - Absolute tolerance in bits

### compareToA(x, a)
`compareToA(x: CR, a: int): int`

Approximate comparison with only an absolute tolerance.  
Identical to the three argument version `compareToRA`, but without a relative
tolerance.  
Result is 0 if both constructive reals are equal, indeterminate
if they differ by less than 2**a.  
**Parameters:**
* `x` - The other constructive real
* `a` - Absolute tolerance in bits

### compareTo(x)
`compareTo(x: CR): int`

Return `-1` if `this < x`, or `+1` if `this > x`.  
Should be called only if `this != x`.  
If `this == x`, this will not terminate correctly; typically it
will run until it exhausts memory.  
If the two constructive reals may be equal, the two or 3 argument
version of `compareTo` should be used.  
**Parameters:**
* `x` - The other constructive real

### signumA(a)
`signumA(a: int): int`

Equivalent to `compareToA(CR.valueOf(0), a)`.  
**Parameters:**
* `a` - Absolute tolerance in bits

### signum()
`signum(): int`

Return `-1` if negative, `+1` if positive.  
Should be called only if `this != 0`.  
In the 0 case, this will not terminate correctly; typically it
will run until it exhausts memory.  
If the two constructive reals may be equal, the one or two argument
version of `signum` should be used.  

### toStringR(n, radix)
`toStringR(n: int, radix: int): string`

Return a textual representation accurate to `n` places
to the right of the decimal point.  `n` must be nonnegative.  
**Parameters:**
* `n` - Number of digits (>= 0) included to the right of decimal point
* `radix` - Base ( >= 2, <= 16) for the resulting representation.

### toStringD(n)
`toStringD(n: int): string`

Equivalent to `toStringR(n,10)`.  
**Parameters:**  
* `n` - Number of digits included to the right of decimal point

Equivalent to `toStringR(10, 10)`.

### BigIntegerValue()
`BigIntegerValue(): bigint`

Return a `BigInt` which differs by less than one from the
constructive real.

### doubleValue()
`doubleValue(): number`

This value is not precise! Use `toStringD` and `toStringR` instead!

Return a `double` which differs by less than one in the least
represented bit from the constructive real.
(We're in fact closer to round-to-nearest than that, but we can't and
don't promise correct rounding.)

### add(x)
`add(x: CR): CR`

Add two constructive reals.

### shiftLeft(n)
`shiftLeft(n: int): CR`

Multiply a constructive real by `2**n`.  
**Parameters:**  
* `n` - shift count, may be negative

### shiftRight(n)
`shiftRight(n: int): CR`

Multiply a constructive real by `2**(-n)`.  
**Parameters:**  
* `n` - shift count, may be negative

### assumeInt()
`assumeInt(): CR`

Produce a constructive real equivalent to the original, assuming
the original was an integer.  Undefined results if the original
was not an integer.  Prevents evaluation of digits to the right
of the decimal point, and may thus improve performance.

The difference between two constructive reals

### multiply(x)

### select(x, y)
`select(x: CR, y: CR): CR`

The real number `x` if `this` < `0`, or `y` otherwise.

The maximum of two constructive reals.

### min(x)
`min(x: CR): CR`

The minimum of two constructive reals.

## class UnifiedReal

### Introduction

> Computable real numbers, represented so that we can get exact decidable comparisons
> for a number of interesting special cases, including rational computations.
>
> A real number is represented as the product of two numbers with different representations:  
>
> **A)** A BoundedRational that can only represent a subset of the rationals, but supports
>    exact computable comparisons.  
> **B)** A lazily evaluated "constructive real number" that provides operations to evaluate
>    itself to any requested number of digits.
>
> Whenever possible, we choose (B) to be one of a small set of known constants about which we
